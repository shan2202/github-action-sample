# events but only for the master branch

  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Runs a single command using the runners shell

      run: echo Hello, world!
    
    - name: Create folder in home folder
      run: |
        mkdir -p ~/new/artifact
